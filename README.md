# LinuxLab8
Final copy of my lab 8 for linux. Use for reference but please do not copy

Lab is pretty straightforward so long as you know the basic linux commands. The only key points are to keep everything in a loop
to keep the code from reaching the exit status. This is standard practice. Ive added additional and unecessary functionality for error
checking/handling using case statements. Also ensure you have if else statements which are able to handle upper and lower case input.
